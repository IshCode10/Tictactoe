# Tictactoe
I developed a Python program for a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent, showcasing my proficiency in object-oriented programming. The program features Player classes for human and AI players, each equipped with methods for move selection. Additionally, I implemented a Tic-tac-toe class to manage game state, including the board, available moves, and win conditions. Leveraging a minimax algorithm within the AI player class enables the AI to make strategic moves. The play function orchestrates the game, allowing users to play against the AI and providing the option for multiple rounds. This project underscores my skills in algorithmic problem-solving, game development, and user interaction through command-line interfaces.
